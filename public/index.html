                        <p>
                            Each week, we'll have a <b>2-hour</b> session of tennis at a pre-booked court. Rackets, balls,
                            and fitness drinks are provided -- just bring a towel!
                            <br><br>
                            Each session includes <b>beginner-friendly, light-hearted</b> coaching, designed to teach you the basics.
                            <br><br>
                            You'll alternate being on-court playing tennis, and off-court getting to know each other with <b>fun
                            conversation topics</b> prepared by our team!
                            <br><br>

                            Each week, we'll also have a surprise group activity, so you get to <b>spend even more time</b> with the group!
                            And, we top it all off with a nice group dinner. Yum!
                            <br><br>
                            Oh and back to tennis -- there may even be some competition and prizes up for grabs...
                            <br><br>
                            All of these are <b>included</b> in the program cost!

                        <p>
                            Hopefully by the end of the program, you meet a <b>special someone</b> that you can continue to get to know better!
